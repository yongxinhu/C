TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

——— TESTING YOUR ALU AND REGFILE ——-
To run the tests we provided you, type './run-sanity-test.sh' or './run-all-tests.sh' from your project folder.
This will copy your alu.circ and regfile.circ into the 'tests' folder and then run the tests.

To see what happened during a test, you can go to tests and open the .circ files.
These are harnesses that are modified to have testing inputs in them. 
You can tick the clock and see the outputs of your ALU, and compare them to what you would expect.

You can also write your own tests for the ALU. In your root project folder, run 'python make_alu_test.py' to
create your own tests. The program will walk you through all of the desired inputs/outputs of the circuit, 
and will give you instructions on how to add this with your other tests. Once you have followed these 
instructions, you will be given further instructions on how to save these inputs into the logisim test
circuit and the script to run the tests. After you do this, you can run it with './run-personal-tests.sh'.
